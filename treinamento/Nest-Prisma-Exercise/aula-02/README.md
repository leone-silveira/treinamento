Dear Teacher Dean,

I hope you doing well, 

I push to git this exercise and also the migration / dev.db
So to simply our testing evaluation, just 
npm run start:dev → to run nest
and 
npx prisma studio → to run 'database'
in the new scenario it will be necessary to install prisma, but this command ask you to install 

"
Need to install the following packages:
prisma@5.22.0
Ok to proceed? (y) y
